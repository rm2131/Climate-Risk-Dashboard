# Climate-Risk-Dashboard

Overview:
An interactive data visualisation dashboard that explores the relationship between temperature change and agricultural production across 184 countries and 7 staple crops from 1961 to 2023.
The project focuses on identifying potential climate stress patterns using correlation-based analysis and multiple visualisations.
Project Description:
This dashboard allows users to analyse how rising temperatures relate to key agricultural metrics:

Yield (kg/ha)
Production (tonnes)
Area Harvested (hectares)

It combines multiple visualisations to present a clear data story on the impact of climate change on food production.
Data Sources:

FAOSTAT Crops and Livestock Data (Kaggle)
IMF Climate Data Portal

Dataset Directory:

The raw crop dataset is saved in data/raw_data_kaggle.csv and the raw temperature dataset is saved in data/raw_data_imf.csv
The cleaned preprocessed merged dataset is saved in data/Merged_FAOSTAT_Cleaned.csv

Features:


Interactive Controls


Selection of metric (Yield, Production, Area Harvested)


Adjustable year range (1961–2023)


Multi-selection of countries and crops


Reset functionality for quick analysis


Visualisations:
Temperature Trend Map
Displays global temperature anomalies over time.


Crop Trend Line Chart
Shows agricultural trends across selected years.


Climate Risk Map
Highlights regions with potential climate-related risks.


Country Ranking Bar Chart
Ranks countries based on selected metrics.


Correlation Heat Map
Displays country–crop level correlation between temperature change and the selected agricultural metric.
A colour scale ranging from -1 to 1 represents the strength and direction of relationships, making patterns easy to interpret.


Key Insight
Global agricultural trends may appear stable due to technological advancements such as improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation.
This dashboard addresses this by focusing on country–crop level analysis to reveal uneven climate impacts and identify more vulnerable regions.
